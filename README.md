# Bitcoin-Python

This notebook showcases a few of the things that can be done utilizing the following libraries within Python: 
  1. [Python Bitcoin Tools](https://pypi.org/project/bitcoin/)
  2. [BIP_Utils](https://pypi.org/project/bip-utils/)
  3. [Blockchain API](https://pypi.org/project/blockchain/)

In the Bitcoin Python notebook, there are tutorials for the following:

**Bitcoin Library**
  - Generating a private key
  - Generating a public key using the private key
  - Creating an address from the public key
  - Generate a multisig address
  - Lookup transactions history using a valid BTC address
  - Sign a message with your private key
    - Derive the public key from the message

**BIP_Utils Library**
  - Generate a randomized mnemonic phrase
    - 24 words were used in ther example, however a small string of words can be created, such as 12 or 15 words
  - Use the mnemonic phrase validation tool to validate the mnemonic phrase

In the Blockchain notebook: 
**Blockchain API**
  - Pull network statistics via the Blockchain API library
  
There is a lot more that can be done with these libraries. I aim to create more example code using them and will update this repository when I have.
