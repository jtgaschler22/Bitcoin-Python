# Bitcoin-Python

This notebook showcases a few of the things that can be done utilizing the following libraries within Python: 
  [Python Bitcoin Tools](https://pypi.org/project/bitcoin/)
  [Blockchain API](https://pypi.org/project/blockchain/)

In the notebook I did the following:
  Generate a private key
  Generate a public key using the private key
  Derive an address from the public key
  Generate a multisig address
  Lookup transactions history using a valid BTC address
  Pull network statistics via the Blockchain API library
  
There is a lot more that can be done with these libraries. I aim to create more example code using them and will update this repository when I have.
